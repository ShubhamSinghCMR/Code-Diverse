Antarctica (Listeni/ænt'?rkt?k?/ or /ænt'?rt?k?/)[Note 1] is Earth's southernmost continent, containing the geographic
 South Pole. It is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic 
Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14,000,000 square kilometres (5,400,000 square miles), it is the 
fifth-largest continent in area after Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. For comparison, Antarctica is 
nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 kilometres (1.2 mi) 
in thickness,[5] which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula Antarctica, on average, 
is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents.[6] 
Antarctica is considered a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland.
[7] The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 °C (-129 °F), though the average for the third quarter (the coldest
 part of the year) is -63 °C (-81 °F). There are no permanent human residents, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people 
reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctic
a include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes,
 penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is tundra.Although myths and speculation about a
 Terra Australis ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen
 and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny first sighted a continental ice shelf in 1820. The continent, however, remained
 largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of resources, and isolation.
Antarctica is a de facto condominium, governed by parties to the Antarctic Treaty System that have consulting status.
 Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits
 military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific
 research, and protects the continent's ecozone. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from
 many nations. The name Antarctica is the romanized version of the Greek compound word ??ta??t??? (antarktiké), feminine 
of ??ta??t???? (antarktikos),[8] meaning "opposite to the Arctic", "opposite to the north".[9] Aristotle wrote in his 
book Meteorology about an Antarctic region in c. 350 B.C.[10] Marinus of Tyre reportedly used the name in his unpreserved
 world map from the 2nd century A.D. The Roman authors Hyginus and Apuleius (1-2 centuries A.D.) used for the South Pole
 the romanized Greek name polus antarcticus,[11][12] from which derived the Old French pole antartike (modern pôle antarct
ique) attested in 1270, and from there the Middle English pol antartik in a 1391 technical treatise by Geoffrey Chaucer
 (modern Antarctic Pole).[13] Before acquiring its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other
 locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established in 
Brazil in the 16th century was called "France Antarctique". The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental
name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew.[14]Antarctica (Listeni/ænt'?rkt?k?/ or /ænt'?rt?k?/)[Note 1] is Earth's southernmost continent, containing the geographic
