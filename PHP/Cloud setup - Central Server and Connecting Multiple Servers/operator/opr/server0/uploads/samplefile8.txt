 (modern Antarctic Pole).[13] Before acquiring its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other
 locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established in 
Brazil in the 16th century was called "France Antarctique". The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental
name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew.[14]Antarctica (Listeni/�nt'?rkt?k?/ or /�nt'?rt?k?/)[Note 1] is Earth's southernmost continent, containing the geographic
 South Pole. It is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic 
Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14,000,000 square kilometres (5,400,000 square miles), it is the 
fifth-largest continent in area after Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. For comparison, Antarctica is 
nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 kilometres (1.2 mi) 
in thickness,[5] which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula Antarctica, on average, 
is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents.[6] 
Antarctica is considered a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland.
