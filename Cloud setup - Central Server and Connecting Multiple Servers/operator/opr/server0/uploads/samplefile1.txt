Antarctica (Listeni/�nt'?rkt?k?/ or /�nt'?rt?k?/)[Note 1] is Earth's southernmost continent, containing the geographic
 South Pole. It is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic 
Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14,000,000 square kilometres (5,400,000 square miles), it is the 
fifth-largest continent in area after Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. For comparison, Antarctica is 
nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 kilometres (1.2 mi) 
in thickness,[5] which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula Antarctica, on average, 
is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents.[6] 
Antarctica is considered a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland.
[7] The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 �C (-129 �F), though the average for the third quarter (the coldest
 part of the year) is -63 �C (-81 �F). There are no permanent human residents, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people 
reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctic
